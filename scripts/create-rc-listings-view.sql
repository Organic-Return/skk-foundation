-- Create a view called "graphql_listings" that maps rc-listings RESO columns

-- Run this in the Supabase SQL Editor for the rc-foundation project.

-- Uses COALESCE to prefer RESO fields, falling back to legacy fields.
-- All COALESCE fallbacks use explicit type casts to prevent type mismatch errors.
